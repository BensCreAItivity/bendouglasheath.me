      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I work with organisations to unlock creativity and better understand the people they serve. With experience across diverse roles and industries, I bring empathy and practical thinking to help solve complex problems and make a tangible difference.</p>
      <p>I’m particularly interested in how we can use technology in ways that benefit everyone, making it more accessible, inclusive, and useful.</p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strategic Design & Facilitation </strong> Bring people together to share ideas, unpack experiences, and find opportunities. Using design-led methods, I guide teams to create strategies and practical plans for action.  </li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong>Turn complex information into clear, meaningful stories that people can understand and act on. My work has included strategic design, investor relations, and brand communication.  </li>
        <li><strong>Human Dimensions of Emerging Technology</strong>Experiment with emerging technologies and the ways they can support and enhance human thinking, creativity, and experience. I’m particularly interested in how AI can help us work smarter (definitely), think deeper (potentially), and make more informed and ethical decisions (perhaps, its complicated..!).</li>
      </ul>
