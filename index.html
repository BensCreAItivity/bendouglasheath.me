      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I help organisations bring design, creativity and empathy to what they do and how it shapes the world around them. I have worked across all sorts of roles and sectors through my journey and love to apply these experiences and a curious mind to new contexts and challenges.</p>

      <h2>This typically involves:</h2>
    <p> </p><strong>Strategic Design:</strong> Bringing people together to share ideas, unpack experiences, and find opportunities. Using design-led methods, I guide teams to create strategies and effective solutions that work in real life.<p>
      
    <p><strong>Narrartive Thinking:</strong> I love turning disparate data into insights and narratives people engage, understand and act upon. This work has included investor relations, design, strategy and brand communications.<p>  
      
    <p><strong>Emerging Technology:</strong> Exploring how emerging technologies augment human creativity and experience. I play a connecting role between the people who use technology and the teams who build it. Helping to translate, question, and shape what’s possible in ways that are safe, ethical, and effective.<p>

      <h2>What I'm interested in (right now)</h2>
    <p> </p><strong>AI (of course...):</strong> beyond generating Ghibli inspired images of my pets, I'm exploring how AI might create better work experiences (getting here), support deeper thinking and learning (arriving fast), and design for better (showing promise, still learning...).<p>
      
    <p><strong>Neurodiversity:</strong> I’m on a path to understand my own particular flavour of this, and how different kinds of brains can better navigate, and shape, a neurotypical world.<p></p> 
  
    <p><strong>Evolving Education:</strong> I’m also learning (and unlearning) what a meaningful secondary education can look like. Self-directed, non-traditional models seem a better fit for many kids and offer a stronger start to their education journey.<p>
    
    <p><strong>Nature Aquariums:</strong> who knew a glass tank filled with water and organic matter could teach you so much about systems, balance, and life itself? This one’s a proper rabbit hole.<p>
