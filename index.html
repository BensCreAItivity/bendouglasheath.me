      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I help organisations apply design, creativity and empathy to define what they do and the impact it has. With experience across diverse roles and industries, I bring ideas and practical thinking to help solve complex problems and make a tangible difference. </p>

      <h2>Three domains I work through:</h2>
    <p> </p><strong>Strategic Design:</strong> Bring people together to share ideas, unpack experiences, and find opportunities. Using design-led methods, I guide teams to create strategies and practical plans for action.<p>
      
    <p><strong>Communication:</strong> Turn complex information into clear, meaningful content and narratives that people can understand and act on. This has included design artefacts, investor and brand communications.<p>  
      
    <p><strong>Emerging Technology:</strong> Explore emerging technologies and the ways they can support and enhance human thinking, creativity, and experience.<p>

      <h2>What Floats my Boat (right now)</h2>
    <p> </p><strong>AI (of course...):</strong> Beyond generating Ghibli inspired images of my pets, I also like to explore the role AI might play in creating better work experiences (that is here), deeper thinking and learning (this is arriving fast) and design for better (_showing promise, but it's complicated...).<p>
      
    <p><strong>Neurodiversity:</strong> I'm on a path to understand my own particular flavour of this and how those diverse neuron can better navigate a neurotypical world.<p></p> 
  
    <p><strong>Evolving Education:</strong> I am learning and (un)learning how alternative and self-directed education might offer a better start in life path for kids.<p>
    
    <p><strong>Nature Aquariums:</strong> Who imagined a glass container filled with water and organic matter could teach you so much about life? This is a real rabbit hole.<p>
