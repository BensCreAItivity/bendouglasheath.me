        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I work with organisations to unlock creativity and better understand the people they serve. With experience across diverse roles and industries, I bring empathy and practical thinking to help solve complex problems and make a tangible difference. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how we can use technology in ways that benefit everyone, making it more accessible, inclusive, and useful.  </p>
