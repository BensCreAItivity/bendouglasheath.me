      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I help organisations bring intentional design, creativity and empathy to their strategy. With experience across diverse roles and industries, I bring ideas and practical thinking to help solve complex problems and make a tangible difference.</p>
      <p>I’m particularly interested in how AI can help us work smarter (definitely), think deeper (arriving fast) and design for better (shows promise, but it's complicated...).</p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p> </p><strong>Strategic Design:</strong> Bring people together to share ideas, unpack experiences, and find opportunities. Using design-led methods, I guide teams to create strategies and practical plans for action.<p>
      
    <p><strong>Communication:</strong> Turn complex information into clear, meaningful content and narratives that people can understand and act on. This has included design artefacts, investor and brand communications.<p>  
      
    <p><strong>Emerging Technology:</strong> Explore emerging technologies and the ways they can support and enhance human thinking, creativity, and experience.<p>
